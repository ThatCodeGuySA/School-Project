    <p class="summ">Watches have been around for some time now. To give you a brief idea of how long, the first watch
      was invented in 1505, by a man who goes by the name of Peter Henlein. Mr Henlein was a locksmith and clockmaker
      from Nuremberg,
      Germany. Though, the first <i><b>wrist</b> </i> watch was made in 1868. It was made by a Swiss watch manufacturer
      called <i>Patek Philippe.</i></p>
    <p class="summ2"> Over time the function of a wrist watch has evolved like most things, but the number one main
      purpose has not changed. That purpose is to keep track of time. But nowadays wrist watches have many uses and
      purposes. To be brief
      I'll
      name a few uses:</p>
    <ul class="uses">
      <big>
        <li><b class="use">Fashion Accessory</b><br>Having a wrist watch can take a 5/10 outfit and change it into a 7
          or 8/10 outfit.Most people<br> nowadays use a watch to compliment or elavate their outfit.</li><br>
        <li><b class="use">Form of Status</b><br>Like most material things, wrist watches also have an element of giving
          a person a certain status<br> in society or in their community. This is due to the fact that watches are not
          the same therefore
          they<br> won't cost the same. If a
          person is wearing a Patek Philippe opposed to another person who is<br> wearing a Casio, the person with the
          Patek will have a 'greater' status. Just because the Patek cost<br> more.</li><br>
        <li><b class="use">Investment</b><br>If you are lucky enough to own a wrist watch which is considered an
          antique, that same wrist watch<br> can be worth double what you got it for in 5-10 years.</li><br>
        <li><b class="use">Technological Device</b><br>Over time the wrist watch evolved and became more and more
          digital. Modern watches have<br> the ability to monitor your heart rate and many other modern feature. Other
          smart watches can <br> sync
          with your cell device, that helps with reading notifications if your cell device is far from you.</li>
