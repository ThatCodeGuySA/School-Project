    <h2 class="aboutHead">Purpose of the website.</h2>
    <p class="learnt"><i><a class="forbes" href="https://www.forbes.com/">Forbes</a></i>, which are an American business magazine that release original articles on finance, industry, investing, and marketing topics. The American business also reports
      on
      related
      subjects such as technology, communications, science, politics, and law. The magazine is well known for its lists and rankings, which include <i>the richest Americans and America's Wealthiest Celebrities</i> among many other types of lists and
      rankings.
      They have tasked us to find and list the most expensive wrist watches (in USD) for the average consumer.</p>

    <h2 class="aboutHead">Contribution of each member.</h2>
    <p class="learnt">Apart from learning the necessary html tags for the website such as; hyperlinks, css, list tag, table tag and img tag, the group also had to learn a few more things with regards to the design of the website. Mukorera MT was
      tasked with learing
      how to add the hyperlinks and the list tag. When asked how he would like to design the hyperlinks Mukorera MT decided that we add the 'hover' effect on the hyperlinks so the reader would know what link they're hovering over. Mthiyane MNS and
      Nzimande NS teamed up to learn how to add and code the navigation of the website. However, they discussed between the two of them and Nzimande NS focused more on the navigation bar whilst Mthiyane MNS would focus more on the code of the
      'Explore'
      button. Mthiyane MNS had to learn a little of javascript code in order for the button to be responsive. Regarding the css of the navigation bar Nzimande NS learnt how to fixate it so that even when the
      reader scrolls down it 'moves down' as well. Masuku VS and Mbutho MA were tasked with the design and layout of the table of the website. They came across a problem when they were adding the information of each watch, the paragraphs were
      unbalanced, so to fix this they figured out that they had to use the css styling element 'bottom' to 'push' the texts up to align them accordingly.</p>

  <div class="funct">
    <h2 class="webFun">Website functionality.</h2>
    <p class="Fun">The website has a few key functionalities, but I will name them all so that you as the reader has a clear understanding of the code behind each part of the website. To start off we'll start with the home page, which has all the
      information about the different types of wrist watches, on that page there are only two functions; the hyperlinks that send you to the respective official home page of each wrist watch. The home page also consists of the 'Explore'
      dropdown-content button. The hyperlinks, you'll see them in 'action' when you click any watch under the 'The types of wrist watches' part of the webpage. For visual aid for the reader, when you 'hover' the cursor over any watch, the
      background-color changes to a darker shade so that you have a visual understanding of which watch you currently 'hovering' over. The button contains a dropdown list with 'About' and 'Group Members' options. Like the hyperlinks when you click on
      the 'Explore' button and 'hover' over any of the two options in the dropdown-content, the background-color changes into a darker shade so that you know what content you're currently hovering over and about to click. When you click on any of the
      two dropdown-content they will send you to that respective content page, and that is where you will see the necessary information. In the 'About' page there are two functionalities, and they are the link that sends you back to the home page when you click on it and the hyperlink that sends you the the home page of Forbes. The only functionality on the 'Group Members' page is the 'Go back to home page' hyperlink, which takes you back to the Home page. Lastly to add, even though its not a functionality the website contains a 'favicon' in the title to help give the reader an understanding that the following website is about watches.</p>

      <h2 class="attention">Disclaimer.</h2>
      <p class="att">The following website was created to help inform the reader about the different types of watches that they can either; aspire and work towards owning because only a selected few can own them due to their price ranges, or 'join'
        the community
        because they as the reader can afford to. It goes on to inform how the addition of any of the watches can help the reader 'elevate' themself.</p>
